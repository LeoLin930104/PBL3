## Evaluating Recommendation Systems

<div style="text-align: justify"> This paper, as the title suggests, focuses on evaluating recommendation systems. The reason I have choose to read this paper is that the core of our project involves a recommendation system. Since we are developing such systems, we have to be able to understand how to evaluate its effectiveness.  <div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">The paper have suggested several methods to experiment on a recommendation system's accuracy. Though there are several of methodology suggested, most of them is bot applicable for our development process. The one that is feasible for us are online experiments.<div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> An online experiment is defined as experiments tested by real users. In simple word, having real users rate the recommendation they received from different recommendation systems. With in the development phase, there is a validation process. Through reading this paper, I believe our team should develop multiple recommendation systems, and implement similar experiments to compare various systems. However, this is optimictic about time constaint for this project. We can still evaluate a single recommendation system if we could only develop one, but preferably multiple systems.<div>
