## Algorithmic Approach to Optimal Route Planning

<div style="text-align: justify"> This paper is math heavy and very hard to understand fully. But thoughout section about the application this paper refers to. I think it is worth noting the similarity of our projec to the topic this paper dicusses.  <div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">Our project involves recommending a route for the users. With a notion of providing a confortable experience for the user. Even though this confortness is highlighted with crowdedness, travel time is also an important aspect. For example, if ther are only non-crowded shrine on the edge of the city, the system shouldn't recommend the user to visit shrines al the way at the other side of the city, which is inappropriate. The paper presented various way to quantify a route and compare differnet route with these quantities. <div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> Although I cannot understand fully about the technicalities presented here in this paper, I understand the importance of route planning to our project. And the paper suggested that therer are algorithmic approach this problem.<div>
