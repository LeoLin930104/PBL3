## Content-Based Recommendation Systems


<div style="text-align: justify"> This system introduces the basic concepts of content-based recommendation systems, which basically give users recommendations based on their interests and the types of attributes they are looking for specifically. The current adaptation of these systems is included in fields such as television programs, items for sale, restaurants, news articles, and, most importantly, web pages. The reason why web pages are particularly important in this case is because our project will tie into information taken from the web. Hence, the content-based recommendation system strongly correlates with the field of our project. The content-based recommendation system works by each item having an attribute, or even multiple, designated to itself while being stored in a database. These attributes are what make the system able to recommend certain things to users since this is the information that it will mainly be using when making decisions. For example, in our case, we will be recommending the closest shrines or temples to users, and by incorporating this content-based recommendation system in our project, we can make destination recommendations based on the information that the user provides to the system allowing them to be recommended the best shrine/ temple to visit. In addition, this paper also mentions user-profiles and how the userâ€™s interaction history with the system can help build the algorithm and make better recommendations. If we bring it back to our project, if the user prefers to visit shrines closest to them, then the system will use its past interactions to make a better recommendation to the user.<div>
