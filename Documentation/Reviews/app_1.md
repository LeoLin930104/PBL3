## Review on ‘Best Time’ API


<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I have looked into an API called Best Time. It is a powerful API where finding desired venues by analyzing foot traffic is available, forecasting data of venues, with search filters. In addition, it also includes documentation on its API reference.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Firstly, it has a free test account and a demo account. The demo allows the user to use some of the features including the search function of tourist attractions, bars, nightclubs, restaurants, cafes and shopping, filters of how busy it is and on what days, time of day, sorting by popularity, rating and time. It has a wide database as it allows the users to find any place in the world so we can use it for our app which is only limited to Kyoto, Japan for the shrines. However, we cannot use the live data function and the number of results is limited. In the free account, we can use the demo functions plus with some more numbers of results but it is still limited. It features hourly data, and the crowded areas are shown in different colors. It incorporates a map where users can interact to see more details on one specific venue with exact location of longitude and latitude and ‘nearby my location’ can also be used. Each venue has its address, ratings, type of the place, opening and closing hours. Users can filter the venues with ratings, review, and price from minimum to maximum. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
There are two packages to buy to upgrade the foot data limitations and venue searches with respective prices at $99 and $399 per month. I suggest that we buy the latter package if we want to use the API to the full potential.
